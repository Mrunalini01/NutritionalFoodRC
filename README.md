# NutritionalFoodRC

Patient’s nutrition is a key factor in their treatment process in the healthcare industry. Every user has their own specific nutritional needs and requirements. An appropriate nutrition policy can therefore help the patient’s recovery process and alleviate possible symptoms. Food recommender systems are platforms that offer personalized suggestions of recipes to users.
However, there is a lack of usage of recipe recommendation systems in the healthcare sector. The present project aims to develop a platform for an intelligent planning of the user’s meals, based on their clinical conditions.
In this context, this project has emerged, consisting in the development and exploration of a new platform for meal planning, incorporating machine learning algorithms for decision support in the recommendation system. Based on the clinical parameters of the patient this project aims at generating accurate diet plans using several methodologies that are currently available and viable.
