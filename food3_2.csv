Once all of the ingredients form a ball add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes.

At this point punch the dough down and knead gently. Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes.While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread. Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven.

In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add little water at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you get the filling ready.Pressure cook arbi with 1 cup water and salt for around 4 whistle and switch off the heat.Once it is pressure cooked, allow the pressure to release naturally and peel the skin.Mash the arbi into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork. Once mashed, add in the finely chopped green chillies, lots of freshly chopped coriander leaves, salt to taste, half teaspoon of cumin powder, half a teaspoon of coriander powder, a teaspoon of dry mango powder, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder and finally if you want it extra spicy, the red chilli powder. Using your fingers again, mix all the ingredients into the arbi until well combined.Divide the arbi filling into 8 to 10 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of arbi paratha dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling.The final step is to stuff the filling into the arbi paratha dough.We dust the paratha dough in flour, flatten it with your finger and place it on a flat surface. Roll them out thin to approximately 3 inches in diameter circle.Take a portion of filling and place it in the center. Next Gather the sides of the paratha dough and bring them together. Remove the little excess dough which popped out when you brought them together. Press the filled arbi paratha dough down.Dust the filled arbi paratha dough in some flour and roll it gently applying just a pressure. Roll it to desired thickness and proceed the similar way with the remaining portions of paratha dough and filling.Preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled arbi paratha.

Take the kernels off the cob and put it in a bowl.Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix thoroughly. Keep aside until later use.For the guacamole, prepare the Avocado guacamole but remember that guacamole needs to be eaten fresh, so this is one component that has to be made last, or just before assembling and serving the burrito bowl.To assemble the burrito bowl, ifyou are preparing one big bowl for your guests, use a fairly deep 8-9 flat bottom bowl or serving dish.A burrito bowl is essentially layered, so begin with the coriander-lime rice. Spread it generously at the base of the bowl.Over it, spoon the spicy beans and spread it around the rice.Next, layer the sauteed peppers over the beans.On top of that goes a layer of guacamole.Spread some corn salsa over it, and top it with the lettuce (if using), cheese and black olives and serve.If you are making individual burrito bowls for a smaller crowd, follow the same sequence of layers, but use smaller sized ramekins for serving.To make a Burrito Bar, simply place all the prepared components on convenient location. Give your guests individual bowls and allow them to choose their favorite toppings to assemble the bowls of their choice.To serve it as a warm winter casserole, once assembled, bake the bowl in a preheated oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes and serve hot with baked Tortilla chips.Serve the Mexican Vegetarian Burrito Bowlfor a wholesome dinner followed by a dessert ofApple Enchiladas.",,http://www.archanaskitchen.com/mexican-vegetarian-burrito-bowl-recipe

Sprinkle some salt and saut the bhindi and the onions on low heat. Keep the pan covered for the few minutes so the bhindi gets cooked.When covered the bhindi releases moisture, but this moisture helps it to cook and soften as well.Once you notice that it has released a little moisture and the bhindi is slightly softened, open the pan and stir fry the bhindi until it is well roasted. Make sure you roast it on medium heat.Roast the Bhindi until you notice it has begun to shrink and has browned. It should not become sticky, slimy and gooey. If it has turned this way, add a little more oil and sprinkle some gram flour/besan and stir it gently. This will absorb the sliminess.The bhindi is a tricky vegetable to cook, so it takes some practice to not making it gooey.Once the bhindi is cooked and well roasted, keep it aside till we prepare the yogurt gravy.To make the Yogurt Curry, add the yogurt into a saucepan add the gram flour, grated ginger, garam masala powder, turmeric powder and chili powder. Whisk until smooth. Add in 1/4 cup of water and whisk again until well combined.Place the saucepan ona medium heat and allow the yogurt mixture to come to a brisk boil. Allow it to boil for a couple of minutes and then turn the heat to low.Simmer the mixture until the yogurt becomes thick and creamy. Once thick and creamy, add in the roasted bhindi and stir. Simmer for a few more minutes. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste.Turn off the heat and transfer the Dahi Bhindi a serving bowl.The final step is to make the seasoning.

Take care when you roll, as the filling might spill out.If you are using the Air Fryer or the Oven, then preheat them at 180 C for about 15 minutes. Place the Kachoris in the Air Fryer Basket or the Baking sheet (for the oven) and bake until the Kachoris are golden brown and crisp on all sides.If you plan to deep fry them, then preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is heated, fry the Kachoris on low to medium heat until you get a deep golden brown color and it is crisp. Once golden, drain on absorbent paper and proceed to make the remaining Kachoris the similar way.Serve these mouth watering Corn and Matar Kachoris as a tea time or evening snack along withGreen ChutneyandDate Chutney.

Add the butter and mix the butter into the flour with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add in a tablespoon of ice water at a time and knead to bring the flour together.Knead to form a firm dough that is firm and does not break apart when you try to press it. Make sure you only add a tablespoon of water at a time, as the warmth of your hand will help bring the flour together to form a dough. Wrap the pastry crust dough in cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.After 30 minutes, roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface. Roll it out to make a circle of 12 inch diameter that is about 1/4 inch thick. Lift the dough carefully from the floured surface and place it in a 9 inch tart pan with a removable base.Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the pans ring. Remove the excess dough that is hanging off the sides of the pan. Place the tart crust in the freezer for atleast another 15 minutes. This process of chilling the crust, helps make the crust flaky when baked.Prebaking the Tart CrustPreheat the oven to 180 C. Once the oven is preheated, Prick the chilled tart crust with a fork, so it does not puff up while in the oven. Cover the tart crust with foil, place pie weights or beans on the crust and prebake the crust for about 25 minutes. The tart will look golden brown but not completely baked. Remove the tart crust from the oven and allow the oven to be on at 180C.Remove the foil and pie weights/ beans and keep the crust aside while we prepare the filling.Method for Chocolate FillingWhisk the eggs in a bowl until light and flully. Keep aside.To make the chocolate filling for the tart, place the heavy cream and milk in a sauce pan over medium heat, add in the chopped chocolate and keep stirring on low heat till you see the chocolate melting half way through. Turn off the heat and proceed to melt the chocolate into the milk and cream mixture in the existing heat. Add in the sugar and salt and whisk the chocolate cream mixture until well combined.Next add in the whisked eggs into the chocolate cream mixture and whisk it in well until well combined. The chocolate cream filling mixture is now ready to be poured into the tart crust.Pour the filling into the tart crust and place it back into the oven and bake for about 15 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy. If you see any bubbles or cracks forming on the surface, take the tart out right away as this indicates that the tart is getting overbaked.Keep monitoring the Chocolate Tart while its in the oven, as the baking times differ from oven to oven.

Keep this thandai masala aside.To begin making the Kulfi Recipe, the first step is to have to condense the milk. For this heat milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan and bring it to boil.Once the milk comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer the milk with almost continuous stirring and reduce the milk to more than half its quantity.It is important to note that during the initial stages of milk condensation frequent stirring is important, but as it begins to start condensing and reaches less than half the quantity it is absolutely important that you stir continuously. This is because condensed milk tends to get stuck to the bottom and sides of the pan and burn leading to a very unpleasant taste. Burning of milk is also toxic so you want to be extra careful.Once it the milk is reduced to more than half of its quantity, stir in the sugar until it dissolves completely. Finally stir in the Thandai Paste Mix and give the mixture a good stir. You can even use a hand blender to give it a good whisk.Turn off the heat and allow the kulfi mixture to cool completely. Pour the thandai kulfi milk in the moulds until 3/4th full, seal them airtight and freeze them in the refrigerator. The Thandai Kulfi takes a good fifteen hours or more to freeze.Once the Thandai Kulfi is frozen you can run the kulfi moulds under water to enable easy release on to the plate.Serve Thandai Kulfi Recipe as a Indian dessert for parties or even make it as a special dessert for the festival of holi.",,https://www.archanaskitchen.com/thandai-kulfi-recipe-festive-twist-to-the-original-recipe

Add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead for a few more minutes until smooth.Set the millet phulka dough aside to rest covered for 15 minutes. Knead once again and divide the dough into 8 portions.Preheat the iron skillet on medium high heat. Roll the portions of phulka (roti) dough into balls flatten these balls with the palm of your hand.Take a portion of the Millet phulka dough, toss it on the flour and roll out into thin circles to approximately 6 inches in diameter. As you roll them out, you can keep tossing the dough in dry flour while rolling this will prevent it from getting sticky when rolling them out.Cook the millet phulka as indicated in the steps below. Continue the process of rolling with the remaining portions of the dough.Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Gas StovePlace rolled dough on the hot skillet. In a few seconds you will notice that small air pockets start to form. At this point flip the rolled dough to the other side on the skillet.After a few seconds turn the flame to high using tongs take the rolled Millet phulka off the skillet and place it directly on the flame. It should balloon into a spherical shape and puff up.Remove the Millet phulka from heat, place it on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up.Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled Millet phulka dough and keep stacking them one over the other.Cooking Millet Phulka (Roti) on Electric StoveThis process can be used if you are using a gas stove as well.Preheat an iron skillet.

The rolled out phulka dough should begin to start puffing out.Flip and cook the other side for a few more seconds.Remove from the heat, place the Millet phulka on a flat plate and optionally spread little ghee on the side facing up. Continue the same process for the remaining portions of the rolled dough and keep stacking them the phulka one over the other.Serve the Mixed Millet Phulka Recipe withSpinach Paneer Kofta CurryandDangar Pachadi With Grated Carrotsto create complete healthy meal.TipMaking the rolled out phulka dough puff into a balloon comes with practice. So give yourself time if you are new to bread making.Even if yours does not puff the first time or the times after, the rotis that you have made are cooked and are edible, so you could consume them with your choice of vegetables.Using thinner rolling pins is the key, as you want to be gentle with the dough.The heavy big ones will make you press harder which might just make it tear. Its well worth investing in a thinner rolling pin and tongs to hold the bread which is available in most Indian stores around the world.Tossing the phulka dough in flour as you roll is another helper that will make the rolling out the dough easier.",,https://www.archanaskitchen.com/mixed-millet-phulka-recipe-ragi-jowar-bajra-wheat-phulka

Mix everything well to make a soft and smooth dough.Take a tray and arrange mini muffin paper liners on it.Pinch a lemon sized ball from the paneer mix and roll it between your palm to make a smooth ball.Place the ball on the paper liner and similarly make more.Your Kaacha Gola is ready and would taste great if you refrigerate it for minimum 1 hour before serving.Kaacha Gola is often served as a dessert during special occasions like marriages, festivals etc.",,http://www.archanaskitchen.com/kaacha-gola-recipe-bengali-sweet-cottage-cheese-balls

Add the caster sugar, and beat on a low speed. Once combined increase the speed to high and whisk till glossy and stiff peaks are formed (For me, it took 5 minutes on stand mixer on a high speed).Add the food colour and beat for 25-30 seconds. Please make sure not to over beat the egg whites.Sift the flour mixture over the whites and fold gently using a flexible spatula. You need a smooth and shinny mix.

On a parchment-lined baking sheet or Macaron mat and pipe the 3/4 inch rounds leaving 1-2 inch gap between each piping.Drag the pastry tip to the side of rounds rather than forming peaks. Tap bottom of each sheet on work surface to release trapped air.Allow the piped macarons to stand on a room temperature for 30-45 minutes. The stand time varies with temperature at different places. What you need is the piped macarons to form a very thin, smooth crust, when you tap it lightly with your finger, the batter will not stick to your finger.Pre-heat the oven to 375 F. Reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Bake 1 sheet at a time, rotating halfway through, until macarons are crisp and firm, about 10 minutes.After each batch, increase oven temperature to 375 degrees, heat for 5 minutes, then reduce to 325 degrees.Let macarons cool on sheets for 2 to 3 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack. If macarons stick, spray water underneath parchment on hot sheet. The steam will help release macarons.When fully cooled, Sandwich 2 same size macarons with the filling of your choice.The next step is to make the chocolate ganache. Heat cream in saucepan over medium-low heat until it comes to a boil.Turn off the heat and add the chocolate and use a spatula or wooden spoon stir in a circular motion from the centre of the bowl until the chocolate and cream comes together into a smooth emulsion.Add the butter and essence and stir will.

"Homemade Quick Puff Pastry Sheet Recipe | Perfect For Puffs, Tarts & Pies.",1,0,0,Vegetarian,1,1,Continental,275.2,7,6.5,2.36,69.75,346.5,1210.9,48.1,6.1,0,10.2,"315 grams All Purpose Flour (Maida),5 grams Salt,220 grams Butter (unsalted) - chilled and chopped into 3/4 inch pieces,120 ml Chilled water","To begin making the Quick Puff Pastry Recipe Sheet for making puffs, measure all the ingredients and keep them ready.Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and give a quick stir to combine it. Add the large cubes of butter into the flour mixture.Ensure each piece of butter is coated fully into flour. When it is coated in flour it will be less likely to melt and also less likely to melt out of the dough later when we roll to make the sheets.This process of covering the butter with flour is called lamination of the butter with flour. If it is not laminated well, the butter will melt out of the dough and you will end up with a puff that is not flaky.Next, squish up the cubes of butter coated with flour by pressing between your fingers. Like shown in the image below.Once all the pieces are squished, just toss them in flour once again. You need to ensure all the butter pieces are well coated with flour.Make a well in the center and add little ice water at a time. Starting with 1/3 cup and then adding more if required a tablespoon at a time. Because every single brand of flour absorbs moisture differently, we need to ensure we add that water little at a time.To mix the water in, toss the flour into the water and it helps the water get incorporated to form the dough without kneading. Do not knead the dough, as it can activate too much gluten.When it gets to a stage where the puff pastry dough forms large clumps, you can knead a little to understand how much more moisture is needed to bring the dough together without breaking those butter shingles.Add a few tablespoons of water if needed again to bring the dry flour together to form the dough.It is important to get the dough to the right hydration level. If it becomes too wet, then the dough will become sticky and might not be the best thing for puff pastry.Gently press and bring the flour together to form a dough without kneading. It is important to work as quickly as possible. If you take too long and knead too long the heat from your hands will melt the butter and make it sticky.We need to ensure that the butter is still in big pieces in the dough after bringing it together.The dough will look rough and not smooth and you will be able to see the big chunks of butter and will not look totally smooth.Divide the dough in two halves and shape each piece into an almost square disk.Wrap each disc of dough in a plastic/ cling film wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. Based on the warmth and the humidity of the region, a minimum one hour will allow the dough to rest before we begin the folds to make the puff pastry sheet.After one hour, remove the dough from the refrigerator.Dust the working surface with very little flour.Open one of the discs while the other is still in refrigeration.First RoundRoll out the dough into a rough rectangle shape to about 1/2 inch thickness. The dough will be tough, so use a little muscle to roll it out.If you feel the dough is sticky with butter, sprinkle a little bit of flour in the area where the butter feels sticky. Ensure you dust off any excess flour.Once you have rolled it into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle, fold the dough into half and then fold the half into a quarter again. This is the first fold.We will proceed to make the 2nd fold in the same round.Dust a little flour if required and roll into a 1/2 inch rectangle again and then do the folds (first into half and then again fold the half into a quarter).Wrap this dough the same cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour until the dough is firm.Second RoundAfter an hour, repeat the process mentioned in the first round again.Once you are done with at least 3 to 4 rounds of rolling, folding and chilling process, the puff pastry dough is ready. You need to ensure you refrigerate the puff pastry dough for at least 6 to 8 hours before you are ready to use it to make puffs, tarts and more.These puff pastry sheets can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 to 4 months. When you are ready to use them, thaw for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature and begin using it for the recipes.",,http://www.archanaskitchen.com/homemade-quick-puff-pastry-sheet-recipe-perfect-for-puffs-tarts-pies

In a bowl, combine together green and yellow zucchini, yellow and red pepper, onion, oregano, basil and liberally drizzle the olive oil.Toss the veggies thoroughly until they are all well coated with the herbs and oil. Pour them onto a lined baking sheet and spread them out evenly.Season with sea salt and black pepper.

It should be slightly warm, not scalding.In a large bowl, add warm water milk mixture and sugar. Mix well. Add 1/2 cup of flour and instant yeast. Mix to form a paste.Cover with a cling film and keep it in a warm place for an hour. The mixture will become frothy after an hour.In the same bowl, add 3 tablespoon of olive oil, basil, oregano, salt, 3-1/2 cup flour, 1-1/2 cup of water. Mix everything and start kneading the mixture until it comes together in to a manageable dough.Once the mixture forms a dough, transfer it on a clean counter and knead the dough with the heels of your palm for 8 to 10 mins.

After that punch punch the dough down, transfer it on to the counter and knead it for another 2 to 3 mins. If the dough is sticky, you can dust it with flour. Divide the dough into six equal parts. Take one part and roll it out into a disc of about 13 to 14 inches of diameter with the thickness of approximately 6 to 7 mm.Now, depending upon the size and shape of the pizza pockets you prefer, cut out smaller circles from the rolled disc. I preferred making them circles of 3 to 4 inches of diameter.Take one cut circle, spread a teaspoon pizza sauce over it. Place a teaspoon of roasted vegetables over the sauce and top with grated mozzarella.Sprinkle little Italian seasoning on top. The sauce, stuffing and cheese quantity will vary based on the size and shape of pocket you choose but remember to do it just right, do not overfill or under fill it.Please ensure that you place the filling in the centre such that you leave 1 cm space at the edges to fold.Place another cut circle on top of the stuffing such that it is completely covered and press the edges to seal it well either using a fork or twist with fingers to form a pattern.Gently snip a small hole on the top to allow the steam from the filling to flow out when baked. Make all the pockets in the same way.Gently place these prepared pizza pockets on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.When the dough is finished, bake these pockets in a pre-heated oven at 200 degrees centigrade for 12-15 mins or until they are light golden brown and baked well.Take them out of the oven and serve warm.Serve theWhole Wheat Roasted Vegetable Pizza Pocketsalong with other appetisers such asMustard Mayo Baby PotatoesandKFC Style Crispy Chicken Popcornfor your house parties with a glass of wine or chilled beer.",,http://www.archanaskitchen.com/whole-wheat-roasted-vegetable-pizza-pockets-recipe

To cook basmati rice separately, wash and soak the basmati rice in water for 20 minutes.Meanwhile add about 3 litres of water in a large vessel and bring it to boil.Once water starts to boil, add about 1 teaspoon of cooking oil and 1 teaspoon of salt. Add the soaked and drained rice, stir gently once and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes (I usually take it off heat by 3-12 minutes).Keep an eye on rice as some brands of basmati rice cooks very fast and some takes time.

We need the masala just to coat the chicken.Take a large wide, deep vessel, add ghee and spread it to coat all the bottom and sides of the pan, reduce the flame to low. Add about 2 full tablespoons of the thick chicken biryani masala and spread it all over the bottom.Next, add cooked basmati rice over the chicken biryani masala and gently spread the rice to cover the chicken.Use a tea spoon and remove the top oily layer from masala and drizzle over the rice, this will add flavours to the rice and also give colour.Repeat the layering process until you have used up all rice and chicken. Over the top sprinkle coriander and mint leaves and browned onions and close with a lid.Ensure the flame is low and place a heavy weight on top of lid to trap the steam inside to cook the Chicken Dum Biryani recipe.

Set aside 4 tablespoons of chopped nuts for decoration.Put the remainder in a bowl and combine it with 13 cup of sugar, cinnamon and cloves and mix well.Method to assemble and bake the baklavaHeat the oven to 170 C. Lay a dish towel on a work surface and sprinkle it lightly with water. Thaw the phyllo dough package according the manufacturers instructions.Unroll the sheets on the towel and then cover it with a second damp dish towel. When unrolling them I encountered several cracks and cuts in the sheets.Do not panic. They are easily repairable and do not make any difference in the dessert.Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Brush a baking pan with melted butter. Take a sheet of phyllo dough and carefully spread it in the pan, folding the sheet in such a way that it fits the pan.Brush the layered sheet with butter and gently press it into the sides and corners of the pan.Lay another sheet on top and brush with butter. Do the same with the third of the sheets. Once 13rd of the sheets have been used, scatter half the nut filling over the layers.Layer another third of the sheets in the pan, buttering each one and pressing into the corners and sides. Then sprinkle the remaining half of the nut mixture evenly.Layer the last third of the sheets, buttering them and pressing them the same way as we did with the previous layers. Brush the top most layer thoroughly with butter and pour any remainder of butter on the top (I ignored the last step. I did not pour the remaining butter. I just liberally brushed the top layer and left it at that).So essentially, after every 3 sheets there is a nut layer for the baklava recipe.With a small knife, cut diagonal lines around 12-inchdeep to mark out the shape. Do not press down too much when cutting.Place the tray in the oven and bake for around 1 hr 15minutes(It took me exactly 1 hr) untilgolden brown in color.Method to make the honey syrupCombine the sugarand water in a saucepan and heat until dissolved, stirring occasionally. Pour in the honey and stir to combine.Boil without stirring until the syrup reaches a soft ball consistency (239F on a candy thermometer). This process takes about 30 minutes.To test the consistency without the thermometer, take the pan off the heat and dip a teaspoon in the syrup. Let it cool down for few seconds and then drop it in a small cup with water.Once dropped into the water, it should form a mushy ball.Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool down to lukewarm temperature. Now add the juice from a lemon and the orange flower water or the vanilla extract.Method to finish the baklava recipeRemove the pan from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot baklava.Pouring the syrup over the hot pastries enables better absorption.With the chefs knife cut along the marked lines almost to the bottom of the pan. Let the pastries cool.Cut through the marked lines completely and carefully lift the pastries with a spatula and arrange them on a plate.Sprinkle the top with the reserved nuts and serve the Baklava for your parties and special occasions.",http://www.archanaskitchen.com/baklava-recipe-turkish-traditional-sweet,
